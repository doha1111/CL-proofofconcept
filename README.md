# CL-proofofconcept

Currently, the sample works for lab and login page are shown. The pages are currently static pages 
shown for demonstrative purposes. 

Question for everyone:

1) Incorporate managed devices and/or lab questions into the containers rather than making it popup.
            
            - It's cumbersome to users to flip back and forth for this, but with our current set up, the spaces for
            the canvas is quite large. Feedback on this is needed.
            - For instance, 'managed tables can be incorporated onto the containers rather than a new popup.
2) Dropdown/actions same as our current model? - This is where a new popup is showing for questions/solutions.


Login page similar to Cisco external webpage.

Lab page where one sees the tasks and topology. The topology is currently an image, as there was no access to
the code.

User can toggle over the tasks, and open the tasks. User can also close the notification that will show up
outlining what the task and topology are for. Navbar is similar to cisco external website. 
The tabs and dropdown will be similar to our current site.
